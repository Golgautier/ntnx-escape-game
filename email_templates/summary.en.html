<p>To conclude this experience, here's a summary of what you've seen today, with a few additional details. Just before to do it, can you take few seconds to fill <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=RnUEu2944U29dSTltveQQ5eGXEKzLRZCmRhCeuhDeeFUOUMyVjRDNEZDWDFDOUVJT0FVU1kzV01QUS4u">this survey.</a></p> ? Thank you very much ! </p>

<h1>Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure (NCI) & Prism</h1>

<h2>Prism</h2>
<p>Prism Central is the main interface when interacting with a Nutanix platform. It groups together almost all the services hosted on our cloud platform, and governs all or part of the Nutanix clusters you own.</p>

<p>Nutanix has done its utmost to make the Prism Central experience simple and intuitive, because we believe that you don't need to be an expert to manage an IT platform on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<h2>Multitenancy/RBAC</h2>
<p>You have experienced this through the use of projects and the assignment of roles. The Nutanix platform enables you to natively manage a multi-user approach, interconnecting with your directories and associating predefined or customised roles with very fine granularity. Each connected user only sees the assets to which they have rights, just as they do for services, thus avoiding any unauthorised interaction or indiscretion with other users.</p>

<h2>The power of categories</h2>
<p>Nutanix provides a notion of category, in key/value format, which can be associated with the majority of cluster elements (clusters, nodes, VMs, images, networks, etc.). These categories enable :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quick identification of elements via searches using these categories</li>
  <li>User rights management for these categorised elements</li>
  <li>Association with management policies (protection, security, storage or affinity)</li>
</ul>
<p>These categories can also be used by your backup tools to identify VMs to be protected.</p>

<h2>Network management</h2>

<h3>Integrated IPAM</h3>
<p>With AHV, Nutanix provides an integrated IPAM. When you create your subnet, you can define a range of IPs that will be allocated to VMs configured using DHCP and deployed in this network. Practical.</p>

<h3>Software Defined Network</h3>
<p>Also with AHV, Nutanix offers a Software Defined Network solution. Among other things, this solution enables you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define micro-segmentation rules: filter network exchanges between your VMs, and between your VMs and the outside world.</li>
  <li>Define private networks isolating your VMs from the rest of the cluster, and enabling the same IP address to be reused, for testing purposes for example.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Integrated Disaster Recovery</h2>
<p>Production needs to be protected, and backup is often not the best solution for quick recovery. To achieve this, Nutanix provides the ability to drive snapshots automatically (without storage costs or impact on performance) and replicate them to a second site if you wish, with an RPO starting at 0. Restarts can be orchestrated automatically (via witness) or manually, so that you can orchestrate the restart yourself to make services available in the order that best suits the operation.</p>

<h2>Distributed, resilient and secure storage</h2>
<p>Nutanix is the pioneer of hyperconvergence, the principle of which is to pool the compute and storage resources of traditional servers into a single pool of resources to be consumed by VMs. In terms of storage, the hyperconvergence solution must manage data resilience and security. Nutanix has made technical choices to optimise the performance of distributed storage, to reduce reconstruction times in the event of disk/node failures and to natively and efficiently manage all data-reduction options (compression, deduplication and/or erasure-coding) as well as encryption (software or hardware).</p>

<h2>Scaling</h2>
<p>The Nutanix solution was developed with the idea of providing the same flexibility as the public cloud, and in particular with its ability to grow without constraints. The main idea is to avoid buying too much and overestimating your needs over the next 5 years. With Nutanix, you choose a solution that allows you to host your short-term needs, and then increase capacity later by adding new nodes. Nutanix manages the addition of nodes very simply (as you have seen), while allowing you to have heterogeneous hardware, and ensuring a stable level of performance despite the increasing power of your workloads.</p>

<h2>Easy and safe upgrades</h2>
<p>With LCM, Nutanix makes it possible to update its software and hardware stack in just a few clicks. Forget the hours spent comparing compatibility matrices and defining upgrade paths for your IS: Nutanix now does it for you. In LCM, tick the products that are proposed for upgrade, and the platform will check the prerequisites and define the order of upgrades. Come back a few hours later and your platform will be up to date, without any service interruption.</p>

<h1>Nutanix Cloud Manager (NCM)</h1>
<p>In addition to the core NCI component, Nutanix offers a range of functions designed to help customers maintain their information systems in operational condition. Here is an overview.</p>

<h2>Customized Dashboards and reports</h2>
<p>The Prism central interface can be customised to create dashboards tailored to the needs of each user. These dashboards can then be shared between users for greater efficiency. Prism also allows the definition of fully personalised reports, which can be generated on demand or automatically, with the potential to be sent to the recipients you see fit.</p>

<h2>Sizing recommendations</h2>
<p>Nutanix monitors your VMs on a daily basis, and will provide you with recommendations on how to size them. Too much CPU, not enough RAM, a VM that doesn't do anything, don't look for it yourself, all this information will come back to you in the form of alerts. Your immediate benefits: resource savings and better SLAs for your applications.</p>

<h2>Smart capacity planning</h2>
<p>Nutanix helps its customers by providing an intelligent capacity-planning engine, capable of estimating when your cluster will be loaded, and giving you 1 year's notice, leaving you time to organise your budget. Are you planning an acquisition? A new application to deploy? Enter your new requirements, and capacity planning will make recommendations for the most appropriate additions (type and number of nodes, date of addition).</p>

<h2>Low-code automation</h2>
<p>Everyone needs automation, but not everyone is a developer. To remedy this, Nutanix provides a low-code automation solution that lets you define a trigger followed by actions of your choice. Simple and effective. For which use-cases?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Automatic categorisation of VMs</li>
  <li>Automatic CMDB update</li>
  <li>Auto-remediation of incorrectly-sorted VMs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Automation with marketplace</h2>
<p>Nutanix provides its 'Self-Service' solution for customers looking for more advanced automation. This multi-cloud automation engine enables blueprints to be defined and deployed via a marketplace, simplifying access to this service catalog for business teams. Deploy your applications in the same way in the cloud or on-prem and implement approval workflows to control deployments.</p>

<h2>Security dashboard</h2>
<p>Nutanix detects asset vulnerabilities and compliance with current regulations, on a single dashboard. It doesn't just concern your data-centre assets, you can also integrate your public cloud assets into the same tool, so you have a global view of the security of your IS.</p>
